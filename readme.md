## Known issues
When I started writing this addon I had big plans, but right now I don't have time to finish it as I would like to. I'm releasing because this way someone can use my code / idea to create better addons.

* Letters will be added after the whole text in the current selected field, don't matter the position of the cursor in the Editor.
* Poor design and visual.
